## Description

- AS A developer
- I WANT a README generator

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
- THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

## Installation

This project makes use of Node.js and Inquirer. Both will need to be installed on your system.
Once Node is downloaded onto your computer, install Inquirer by running "npm instal inquirer@8.2.4" in the terminal.


## Usage

After all installs are complete, run "node index.js" in the termial. A series of prompts will ask the user to answer questions that will collect information needed to generate a README.md file.
- WHEN I enter my project title
- THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
- THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
